Recreate google homepage.
Reflect when complete, list skills used.
------------Reflection-----------------
I did the easy version. Harder than I thought.

Used devtools to inspect the google homepage.
The header was ok. Getting the sprite to work
was a pain, had to display inline-block;

Stuff kept overlapping, so I set header width
to 100%. I think that fixed it?

Text-align center and margins centered my search.

Padding and border radius made it oval-like.

I added a hover border for feeling lucky boxes.
IT kept shifting the other box, because i had no border.

So, i added a border same color as the box, then 
changed hover to alter only border color. Fixed.

Footer took ages. Didn't know how to keep it at 
bottom.

Fix was: Media query for when below 500px height.
Will sticky then. Above 500px, it's absolute
position and 0px bottom. Then it got stuck.

So, I have to set the height of body to 100%, to
respond to resizing. Now footer is always on 
bottom of window.

Overall, I learned quite a bit playing around with
this project. It's a rough start, but I will get
better.
